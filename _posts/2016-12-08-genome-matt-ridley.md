> “The genome is a book that wrote itself, continually adding, deleting and amending over four billion years.”

Genes are a fascinating subject. We start life with a single cell and in the single cell is a tiny molecule called DNA which consists of a double helix chain consisting of four different nitrogen containing organic molecules called C, G, A and T repeated three billion times.

In this "code" are **ALL** the instructions that each cell needs to split and replicate into 37.2 trillion cells over several years to go from a cell in the womb to a young adult. A literal book of life that still, in 2016, remains mostly undeciphered despite tremendous progress in genomics.

This book was written in 1999 as I discovered and so many parts are probably outdated. It has an interesting structure. Each chapter talks about a single gene in the human genome which essentially makes the book 23 essays on different topics in genetic research.

As such, there are defintely several chapters that are extremely interesting and several chapters that are kind of in the middle and several chapters where the matter gets outright too dense to be interesting. It is fascinating introduction into what genes are and how they influence many aspects of our lives but lacks a central theme.

However, the book does do a great job of giving a snapshot of many facets of genes - genetic diseases and disorders, nature vs. nurture, the ethics of genetics therapy, the history of eugenics, evolution, cancer, the relationship between genes and behaviour, personalities and intelligence as well as a few other topics.  

I give this book four stars --- it's no *The Selfish Gene* or *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks* but defintely a worthwhile read.  I strongly suspect that *The Gene : An Intimate History* by *Siddhartha Mukherjee* is more comprehensive and up to date - a book that I found out only after I had already purchased this one.
