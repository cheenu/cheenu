Sceptical Patriot explores a collection of selected "India Facts" that are
frequently a part of Whatsapp forwards and examines the truthfulness of them.
The format is clearly lifted from Snopes.com (before it became like a news
website) but it is well written even if the author tries a little too hard
to be funny.

It is a fun light head and a great gift idea to all the Uncles on your family
Whatsapp group who remain convinced that the new Rs 2000 notes has a GPS
tracker embedded in it and that NASA hired 500 Sanskrit scholars to create
a programming language based on Sanskrit.
