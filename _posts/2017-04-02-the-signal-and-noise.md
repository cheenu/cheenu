The Signal and the Noise is an interesting high level introduction to
forecasting events. Each chapter talks about forecasting in a certain field
namely - economic recessions & depressions, elections, baseball, weather,
earthquakes, economic growth, diseases, chess, poker, stock markets,
climate change and terrorism with a chapter introducing Bayesian statistics.

It illustrates how exactly things such as hurricanes or your opponents next
move in chess are forecasted and what factors prevent them making really
accurate predictions and why some in fields it is much harder to predict than
others. It is really nice non-technical introduction to the cottage industry
of making predictions.

There is also lots of to learn and apply to your own life. The two key
takeaways for me are - 1. Don't disregard qualitative factors that affect a
forecast just because they can't be measured and 2. Think in probabilistic
terms rather than in certainties.
