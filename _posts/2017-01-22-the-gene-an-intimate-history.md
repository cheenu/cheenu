The Gene: An Intimate History is a fascinating historical record of the
field of genetics from its inception to today. Having read [Genome: An
Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters](http://www.amazon.in/Genome-Autobiography-Species-23-Chapters/dp/0060894083) and a few other long form articles on
genetics, it is clear to me that the author has done an incredible job of
reducing a very complex topic to simple layman explantations.

The completeness of the book is what makes it stand out. It covers not only
important scientific and technological breakthroughs but important political
events surrounding the field of genetics (and there has been no shortage of these)
as well as the ethical and moral compendiums related to genetics.

With the advent of CRISPR CAS9 making genome editing a possibility, it is clear
that genetics will dominate the conversation on scientific breakthroughs in the
coming years and The Gene: An Intimate History is the ideal guide to help you
navigate the world of genetics.
