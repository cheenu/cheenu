I'll keep this short. I expected a book on a systematic way to build a self perpetuating referral network or as the title says - *Endless Referrals*.

Unfortunately though, this book is barely about referrals but mainly about sales - how to prospect, cold calling scripts, how to follow up, how to work room - basically anything that can be found in a Sales 101 training courses.

Its entire advice on getting more referrals is do something for people who might refer you to make them more likely to refer you. If the other person has a business, figure out what that person's ideal target customer is so that you can refer people from your network to them. If not, figure out something else that you can do for that person.

It is more of a sales book that seems a rehash of Dale Carniege's legendary *How To Win Friends And Influence People*. There are no new ideas, no novel systems and half the book is filled with random anecdotes.

Give it a miss.
