This book is pretty old (last revised circa 1970) but I was still expecting
a book with timeless advice on investment wisdom. Instead, the book was too
routed to what one should do and not do in 1970. And also too focused on the
minutia of US specific securities.

I'd recommend giving it a skip - its not badly written by any measure but
its kind of irrelevant in the modern day. I'm sure they are better books out
there on investing. Anyway, most of investment advice boils down to - invest
only in index funds, so not sure whether a book is really required :).
