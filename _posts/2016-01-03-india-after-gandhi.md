India After Gandhi is a masterpiece in contemporary Indian history. We have
extensive exposure of all Indian history periods from the Indus valley to the
last days of the British Raj - learning from our school textbooks which cover
these periods extensively and then through the rich body of art and literature
and finally through jingoist Facebook wall posts and Whatsapp forwards.

However, the average Indian remains relatively unexposured to the events of
post-British India. We know, in general, that Nehru was a great PM and about
Emergency and Bofors and the wars India fought against Pakistan and China - but
the circumstances leading to all these - we know really little about, compared
to say, the 1857 Rebellion which was brought about by using catridges made
from cow and pig fat.

India After Gandhi seeks to rectify this. It starts off in 1946, when the
British have just agreed to leave India and ends with Rajiv Gandhi becoming
the PM in 1984. 40 years of contemporary Indian history are documented in
considerable detail totaling over 600 pages written in a rich, engaging
narrative history format.

Despite the book being completed in 2008, the Rao, NDA and UPA years are not
covered. The Rajiv Gandhi years are covered very briefly. The author explains this decision by stating that 30 years usually need to lapse before records are de-classified and so he cannot do justice to the
time period from the late 80s to today.

The author, however, compensates by adding another 150 odd pages (yes, the book
is nearly 800 pages long) written in the form of social commentary which
bridges these years from Rajiv Gandhi to the start of UPA. While not as
detailed or rich as narrative history in the first 600 pages, they are still
extremely insightful and a valuable complement.

In summary, India After Gandhi is defintely a must read book for every
"thinking" Indian and also a very useful book for a foreign resident trying
to make sense of this exercise in bewilderment that is the Indian subcontinent.
