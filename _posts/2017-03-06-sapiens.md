Sapiens is what I like to call an alternative history book. By alternative
history, I don't mean a version of history with different historical events but
history looked from a different perspective.

Rather than list history as a series of events along with their causes (which
are always considered to be inevitable with the benefit of hindsight), Harari
approaches all the events of history from an evolutionary perspective.

It is defintely a very interesting book - one that you'll really have to
read with an open mind because it challenges the conventional perspective. It is
my first five star read of the year and I'd recommend every adult to read it.
