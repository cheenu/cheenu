Ruchir Sharma is an "emerging markets" investor and in this book, he tries to
outline factors that make a nation a breakout success. It is defintely an
entertaining read, light on economics and heavy on an assortment of facts and
numbers. This book was written in 2011 and it is fun to see what predictions
of his have come true and what haven't.

It is actually pretty impressive how much spot on he was on almost all of
his predictions (Turkey being the only exception which he got specularly wrong)
which shows this guy really knows his stuff. The book is actually a decent
insight into his thought process for evaluating whether an "emerging" market
is worthwhile investment or not.

The book suffers from a lack of process to evaluate whether a nation will be a "breakout"
but that is because there is no process - each and every nation is successful in
its own way. It is actually pretty insightful in how arbitrary a nation's success
can be.

He also evaluates a nation's success only by purely economic
factors - per capita growth rate and public market performance. Non-economic
metrics such as income inequality and HDI are not covered at all. Which makes
sense considering he is an investor not a social economist but the bias shows
in his constant dismissal of welfarism due to little economic benefit (but huge
societal benefits).
