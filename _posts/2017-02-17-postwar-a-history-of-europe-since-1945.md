Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 is no easy read. 800 of pages in tiny
font and tiny margins and a serious lack of line spacing. I originally targeted
completing this book within 10 days but it took almost a month to work through
the book, 50 pages at a time.

If it isn't clear yet - this book is comprehensive. A little too comprehensive
maybe, I felt the author was basically repeating himself at same times and it
could have maybe fitted in within 550 or 600 pages. But it does give a comprehensive
overview of European history - not just political or military history but
cultural and economic history too.

I really recommend this book (over older European history books targeting WW2 or
before WW2) since it explains a lot of modern Europe and if you're actually
traveling to Europe or have traveled to Europe, it will defintely make your
trip a lot more interesting.
