This book is usually a permanent fixture on almost every "100 Books To Read
Before You Die" booklists. And it is easy to see why.

Books such as "Grapes Of Wrath" capture historical snapshots of time they are
set in, in a way that no history textbook or even biography can. I am
envious of the wealth of works under the genre of the "Great American Novel".
Although they are some classics in Indian literature, I really wish we had the
same depth of works capturing our cultural history.

The book follows a predictable course of an American sharecropper family made
redundant by the arrival of tractors and modern farming techniques and their
transition into migrants looking for work.

John Steinbreck, however, uses his sheer mastery of the spoken word to write
an incredible novel. You, despite having nothing in common, relate to the Joads,
share their misery and share their helplessness. 

Read it, not for the story or the setting - although both are pertinent but
for John Steinbreck's writing style. You'll be dismayed twice - first at
the story arc of the Joad family and second, because you know you'll never
ever be able to write anything as good as John Steinbreck in your life.

Oh, and the ending. I won't say more, I can see a lot of people hating it -
but oh, what a finish.
