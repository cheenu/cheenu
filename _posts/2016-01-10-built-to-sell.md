This book has an interesting format - which reminds me of Who Moved My Cheese.
It is written as a fiction story of a guy (Alex Stapleton) who wants to sell his
business and reaches out a mentor (Ted) for help. However, he soon discovers
that his business is basically unsellable and begins a transformation of his
business into a sellable one guided by Ted.

Despite the title, the lessons imparted are general principles towards building
a cash flow positive, scalable service business. Something I've seen called as "Productized Services". Although the book is targeted at people running
IT centered service businesses, I feel that is a great read for anyone running
a business including non-IT and non-service oriented businesses.

The positive in this book, which elevates it from being a regular 3 star generic business
book is the style which it is written - it ensures that it is an engaging read.
The negative of this book which prevents it from getting 4 stars is that
the advice is a little too general. But it still serves as a useful reminder on what
is important to focus on.
