Virtual Freedom:  How to Work with Virtual Staff to Buy More Time, Become More Productive, and Build Your Dream Business by Chris Ducker is a disappointing read. It is
a 5000 word blog post repeated over and over again in a really generous
big font and double line spacing to make its target of 250 odd pages.

The advice on hiring and managing a staff of virtual or remote workers is just a
rehash of industry accepted methods of hiring and managing. The case studies barely
even cover the companies workflows and look more like testimonials for the
author's service and a bunch of tools used to manage virtual teams.

I recommend to give this a miss - Tim Ferris in *Four Hour Work Week* manages to
pack more solid advice on hiring virtual assistants in a few chapters than
Chris Ducker manages to do in an entire book.
